# DuplicateDetection
A beneficiary is entitled to get only one Import/Export Code. Network analysis revealed that a single beneficiary was enrolled using different attributes such as mobile number, email, PAN, bank account number, etc. and obtained multiple IECs. In Government incentive schemes, the issue generally faced by authorities 
are duplicity and fraudulent claims. The various investigative agencies try to analyses the data for such claims and employ various heuristic algorithms in 
detecting anomalies from the data, which is generally referred to as forensic accounting. The Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) register all exporters 
and importers of goods with IEC Code. Various incentives are provided to exporters to encourage exports for earing foreign exchange. It was observed that 
these schemes were misused by some exporters by making multiple claims for same export with different identification details. A beneficiary is entitled to get 
only one Import/Export Code. However, network analysis revealed that a single beneficiary was enrolled using different attributes such as mobile number, email, 
PAN, bank account number, etc. and obtained multiple IECs. In in the proposed system data points analysed are Unique IE Code Other Identification attributes, 
such as Mobile number, E-mail, PAN Number. More attributes viz GST No etc. can be added to further such duplicate registrations. In the proposed system
project of network analysis gets data into the proper structure by cleansing and transforming the data and then creates specific object classes for the network
package, as well as for igraph and tidygraph, which is based on the igraph implementation. Then the creation of interactive graphs with the viz Network
and network D3 packages is done. Finally, the effectiveness of the deduction using network analysis is tested on the test data by calculating the confusion 
matrix with the deducted outcome and the actual outcome. Since it an attribute analysis, the accuracy between the analysis outcome and the actual outcome was 
calculated. The accuracy value is 94.6% indicating the efficiency of this technique.
